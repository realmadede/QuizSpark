# QuizSpark

QuizSpark is an interactive, real-time classroom quiz application built to make learning incredibly engaging and highly competitive. 

I built this project because I firmly believe that learning should be fun. Teachers can easily create quizzes, host live game sessions, and broadcast questions to their class in real-time. Students jump right into the action seamlessly using a simple 6-digit Game PIN on any mobile browser, battling it out for the top spot on the live leaderboard.

## Exciting Features

* **Real-time Synchronization:** Built securely with Socket.io, questions and answers instantly push to player devices exactly when the host triggers them.
* **Player Avatars:** Students can express their personality by selecting from a fun set of predefined animal and robot avatars before joining a lobby.
* **Teacher Dashboard:** A comprehensive, secure authentication system allows educators to create, edit, and manage an unlimited number of quizzes.
* **Advanced Session Controls:** Teachers can toggle "Auto-Advance" to let the game run itself, or manually control the pace of every question and leaderboard reveal.
* **Dynamic Quiz Editor:** Supports multiple choice and rapid True/False question templates with customizable timers.
* **Strict Publishing Security:** Quizzes are kept safely in "Draft" mode until the teacher is completely ready to publish and play.
* **Frictionless Joining:** Students do not need accounts. They simply enter a Game PIN, pick an avatar, and start playing immediately.
* **Live Leaderboards & Analytics:** The system tracks right and wrong answers, automatically calculating player accuracy and rankings at the end of the game.
* **Podium & Confetti Finish:** The game ends with an exciting 3-tier visual podium and celebratory confetti animations to reward the top players.
* **Robust Authentication:** Includes full email verification and a secure password reset workflow.
* **Mobile First Design:** Fully responsive player screens that work perfectly on any mobile browser.

## Technology Stack

**Backend (Server)**

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) & [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) (API routing)
* [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) (WebSockets for real-time multiplayer)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (Relational database)

* [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/) (For secure email communications)

## Local Development

This is the recommended way to run and test QuizSpark while developing the project.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) installed and running locally

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/realmadede/QuizSpark.git
cd QuizSpark
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

You will need to install dependencies for both the frontend (root) and the backend.

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Navigate to the `backend/` directory and copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Adjust the database credentials to match your local PostgreSQL setup:

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

*(You can also configure frontend variables in the root directory by copying `.env.example` to `.env`, though it defaults to `localhost` automatically).*

### 4. Database Setup

With your `.env` configured and PostgreSQL running, initialize the database schema using Prisma. From inside the `backend/` directory, run:

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate
npm run prisma:generate
```

### 5. Running the Application

You need to start both the backend server and the frontend client simultaneously. Open two separate terminal windows.

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

(You should see "Server running on port 5000" and "Connected to Database" in your terminal)

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**

```bash
# From the root QuizSpark folder
npm run dev
```

(The frontend UI will start on `http://localhost:5173`)

## Production Deployment

If you want to deploy QuizSpark to production cloud infrastructure, please see our detailed deployment guide. The project configuration fully supports deployments to providers like Vercel, Render, or Fly.io.
